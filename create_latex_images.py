# This script will parse you readme.md file and create images for each equation found as
# [latex:your_equation](your_image_file)
#
# we recommand using svg image files as they give nice vectorial images without pixel
# aliasing and they are in a text format which is good for versioning with git or
# mercurial # has the svg text remains unchanged for unchanged euation and thus it
# avoids pushing again and again the same # images on the server of the aleready
# compile equations each time a new equation is created Martin de La Gorce April 2016
# up to date version of that script can found on
# https://github.com/martinResearch/markdownLatex
